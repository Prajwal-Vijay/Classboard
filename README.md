# Classboard Application 
In the following application we have a pdf editor, note taking and mainly a whiteboard inspired from Jamboard.
The packages used are fabricjs, PDFjs and pdfkit.


PS: Was completely created in the pre ChatGPT era, without the help from any sort of code assistant, in 2021, when I was attending my school online.
